## Overview

## Calculations
All data is mapped directly and therefore requires x-y-matrices, see input & export.
To improve the contrast across maps, each map is individually normalized. Please mind, that this applies to (semi-)quantitative EDXS or EMPA maps.
For quantitative maps, the normalization step should be skipped and units printed printed in the colorbar appropriately.

The normalization step sets the map minimum $v_{min} = 0$ and sets the displayed maximum to $v_{max} = 0.1 \cdot Map_{max}$.
Here $Map_{max}$ refers to the maximum of the map overall, which can be noise or some strong local segregation.
